            You can use lumX in your Sass project to get all variables and mixins available.<br />
            We'll bring you soon a full documentation for our CSS framework.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a settings file where you need to specify the roboto font path and the material design icons font path relative to your built css file.<br />
                You can override lumX default settings (dist/scss/main/settings/_settings.common.scss) if you want to change sizes, colors, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, create your main file where you will import your settings first and then lumX main scss file (dist/scss/main/_lumx.scss).
            </li>
        </ul>
